PSA: PE Ratios Don’t Matter – You’re Missing Out on Gains,2024-12-05 00:08:29,"PE ratios are just numbers. That’s it—they don’t inherently mean anything.

Look at companies like TSLA, NVDA, WMT, and COST. These are market leaders in their respective sectors with massive competitive moats. These companies are built to weather almost any economic environment and are likely to be around for decades. Betting against them based on valuation metrics like PE ratios is shortsighted.

People who avoided investing in Amazon, Walmart, or Google in their earlier years because of “high valuations” missed out on generational wealth-building opportunities. History shows that great companies often earn their high valuations by continuing to dominate and expand.

And before someone inevitably brings up Enron or other frauds—those are completely different scenarios. Those collapses were driven by accounting scandals and a lack of actual business fundamentals. TSLA, NVDA, and others are the opposite: they have solid growth prospects, cutting-edge innovation, and established track records.

Instead of obsessing over traditional valuation metrics, focus on the quality of the business, its leadership, and its long-term potential. Don’t let PE ratios scare you away from companies that could define the future.",stocks
Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,2024-12-04 23:19:53,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

Rivians everywhere I look! ,2024-12-04 21:13:27,"I know this is anecdotal, and not a good reason to invest, but I have been seeing Rivians everywhere lately. I decided to do a little digging. 

Rivian's sales were up 71% compared to Q1 2023. The company has been ramping up production, although it has faced some challenges due to supply chain issues. Rivian has adjusted its delivery targets for 2024 to between 50,500 and 52,000 vehicles.

I understand that they have been struggling to make a profit, which definitely cannot be overlooked. But, there is no denying that the demand is there. The backing is also there. Volkswagen has invested in Rivian. In 2024, Volkswagen announced an investment of up to $5 billion in Rivian, with the goal of developing next-generation electric vehicle architecture and software technology. The two companies formed a joint venture to collaborate on this project.

The stock has been sitting in the 10-15 dollar range the last 6 months. It seems to me that the market is waiting for it to break one way or another. If it breaks to the upside I could see a lot of people that have been waiting on the sidelines hop on board. 

This is just my quick two cents on the stock. Would love to hear everyone’s else’s opinion. I decided to throw 100 dollars on it as a fun bet. I’m definitely routing for them. I think their trucks looks really cool, and I love the new cars in the pipeline. 

I’m sure this post will get marked as low effort, but I don’t want to have my post be 5 pages of AI, like every other post.

Amazon sued by DC attorney general for allegedly excluding neighborhoods from Prime delivery,2024-12-04 13:53:24,"Washington, D.C.’s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation’s capital from access to Prime’s high-speed delivery.

The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has “secretly excluded” two “historically underserved” D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon’s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.”

In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.

The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience “significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,” the lawsuit says.

Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.

Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company said it would expand access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after a Bloomberg investigation found Black residents were “about half as likely” to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.

The ZIP codes in Schwalb’s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.

The Federal Trade Commission also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and “sabotaging” their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was “false on the facts and the law.” The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.

According to Scwalb’s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district’s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to “put an end to Amazon’s deceptive conduct,” as well as for damages and penalties.

To get packages to customers’ doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.

Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company said it recorded its “fastest Prime delivery speeds ever” in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.

In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

"GM expects more than $5 billion impact from China restructuring, including plant closures",2024-12-04 13:21:20,"General Motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with SAIC Motor Corp. in China to cost more than $5 billion in non-cash charges and writedowns, the Detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing Wednesday morning.

GM said it expects to write down the value of its joint-venture operations in China by between $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion. It also anticipates another $2.7 billion in charges to restructure the business, including “plant closures and portfolio optimization,” according to the filing.

GM, which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in China, did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures.

“As we have consistently said, we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market. We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement,” GM said in an emailed statement.

GM said it believes the joint venture “has the ability to restructure without new cash investments” from the American automaker.

A majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as non-cash, special item charges during the fourth quarter. That means they will impact the automaker’s net income, but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes – a key metric monitored by Wall Street.

GM’s operations in China have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism, and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold.

Equity income from GM’s Chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015.

GM’s market share in China, including its joint ventures, has plummeted from roughly 15% as recently as 2015 to 8.6% last year — the first time it has dropped below 9% since 2003. GM’s equity income from the operations have also fallen, down 78.5% since peaking in 2014, according to regulatory filings.

GM’s U.S.-based brands such as Buick and Chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors and others. The joint venture models accounted for about 60% of its 2.1 million vehicles sold last year in China.

Prior to this year, the only quarterly losses for GM in China since 2009 were a $167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an $87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022.

The Detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its Chinese operations this year, totaling $347 million. That includes a loss of $137 million during the third quarter.

I predict Apple will acquire Nissan in the next 18 months,2024-12-03 20:06:44,"The Japanese automaker is facing severe financial challenges and may run out of cash within 12 months, putting it on the brink of bankruptcy.

Apple, with its bold ambitions to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market, has already invested over $10 billion in R&D for the Apple Car. Despite canceling the project earlier this year, that investment exceeds Nissan's current valuation.

Partnering with Nissan could help Apple overcome the manufacturing hurdles it faced with its EV project. Nissan has proven expertise, having produced the Nissan Leaf, the best-selling non-Tesla EV of all time.

The global EV market is one of the fastest-growing industries, projected to double by 2030. By acquiring Nissan, Apple could transform its vehicles into sleek, cutting-edge products that seamlessly integrate into the Apple ecosystem.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,2024-12-02 22:10:38,"A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla, CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker.

GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,2024-12-02 21:15:49,"General Motors plans to sell its stake in a $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution, the automaker announced Monday.

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility, which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion. The sale is part of a non-binding agreement between the two companies that’s anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year, GM said.

The nearly completed, 2.8 million-square-foot plant in Lansing, Michigan, was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC, following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational.

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022, and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago.

GM’s move comes as the automaker attempts to right-size production of electric vehicles and confronts slower-than-expected consumer demand. It also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump.

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES rival Samsung SDI.

“We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release. “When completed, this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity that’s nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient.” 

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment. The plant, which currently employs nearly 100 people, was expected to begin operating by the end of this year.

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility, GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14-year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells.

Prismatic cells are a flat, rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure, which allows for space-efficient packaging within battery modules and packs. GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs, while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components.

“We’re focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance, enhance safety, and reduce costs. By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution, we’re taking an important step towards these goals,” Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery cell and pack, said in a release.

GM had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat “Ultium” pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line. Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal. So things are staring to look more peaceful. Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace.

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit  constellations.

 MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.""

And then I heard this:

MDA Space, which is a sleeping giant merely because it trades in the Toronto Stock Exchange rather than US, is exploring listing in the US, according to comments by its CEO;

“Management suggested that it continues to explore a potential dual stock listing in the U.S.""

Now I am not sure how a dual listing will effect my 500 MDALF shares but if I had to guess I would say it will be a good thing.

There have been posts on Reddit about how bad of a company they are to their employees, but just like Yelp you usually only hear about the bad apples, not the good ones, so I take that with a grain of salt. This article that came out today today says they are ""one of Toronto's greatest employers""

$CVNA - Carvana and its close relationship with DriveTime,2024-12-04 22:44:51,"Too many weird things happening with this company and industry, so I might break this DD into parts.

*Not financial advice. Borderline fiction. Don't take what is written here for granted.*

TL;DR: Carvana has ""*not at arm's length arrangements*"" with DriveTime and this could be boosting their metrics. Meanwhile, Carvana's controlling shareholder and DriveTime's owner, Ernie Garcia II, has sold $1.4 billion in shares over the last few months.

# Numbers:

* Market cap of $53 Billion
* P/E ratio: 31,000x (yup, thousands)
* D/E ratio: 10x ($6.2B debt for just $600M equity)
* Founded: 2012 (as a spinoff of DriveTime)
* Employees: 13.700
* CEO: Ernie Garcia III (son of Ernie Garcia II, owner of DriveTime, and controlling shareholder of Carvana) ([TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CVNA/financials-overview/))
* Insider Trading: +$1.6bi on stock sold in L12M, including:
   * Ernie Garcia II: \~$1.4 billion since April
   * Mark Jenkins (CFO): +$72 million and plans to sell more ([YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carvana-ceo-father-sees-1-163234402.html), [SecForm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1690820.htm))
* \~9 million shares issued in Q2, bringing $347 million as cash and further diluting shareholder's equity. ([Q2 QR](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q2-2024.pdf))
* *""Record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%, a new all-time best for public automotive retailers""* is a highlight of their Q3 results. ([CVNA Q3 2024](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-earning-release-q3-2024.pdf)).

# Hypothesis

Given that Ernie Garcia II owns DriveTime, Bridgecrest, and SilverRock and remains Carvana's controlling shareholder, Carvana could have been given beneficial contract terms that improved its metrics and, consequently, its market price.

Take a look at these paragraphs from their [2023 Annual Report (page 20)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000093/cvna-20231231.htm):

>""We were incubated by and may benefit from our relationship and a series of **arrangements with DriveTime not always negotiated at arm’s length**, as DriveTime is controlled by our controlling shareholder who is also the father of our chief executive officer. (...)

>DriveTime built certain of our inspection and reconditioning centers (""IRCs"") in Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas and is now our landlord at some such sites. Verde Investments, Inc. (""Verde""), an affiliate of DriveTime, formerly leased to us our Arizona IRC and sold it to us in 2020. We have also historically leased certain of our hubs from DriveTime. (...)

>Consequently, certain of **our historical costs and expansion activities may not accurately reflect our future costs and expansion** to the extent that DriveTime no longer provides us with such services or refuses to continue doing so at currently contracted-for prices.""

>""We continue to periodically engage DriveTime, its affiliates, and other entities controlled by our controlling shareholder to provide us with certain services, including the administration of certain VSCs and other related products sold to our customers. (...)

>Additionally, **DriveTime has in the past and may in the future purchase or sell certain vehicles or automotive finance receivables from or to us**. However, there can be no assurance that they will do so on the same or similar terms, or at all. As a result, our historical results may not be reflected in our future results.

>Before and after we sell automotive finance receivables originated by us, **DriveTime performs ongoing servicing and collections**. If DriveTime is unwilling to enter into servicing arrangements for our future automotive finance receivable transactions on terms or at prices consistent with their historical prices or at all, our revenues derived from the sale of those receivables may decline as a result. (...)""

By **""not always negotiated at arm’s length""**, it implies they might be receiving favorable benefits in terms of assets, revenue, and expenses. This raises the possibility that their reports may not fairly represent their future costs and expansion, as some aspects could be currently ""hidden"" under the financial and operational support from DriveTime.

According to their Q3 2024 reporting, \~15% of their L9M operating income comes from related parties. ([Q3 Report](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2024.pdf))

# ELI5:

1. Carvana could be unintentionally overstating revenues and understating future expenses through its favorable agreements with DriveTime;
2. Carvana share price increases based on its *""all-time best""* metrics;
3. Ernie Garcia II - Carvana's controlling shareholder and DriveTime's owner - sells $1.4 billion in stock;
4. At some point, DriveTime and its affiliates may change or dismiss the arrangements, and Carvana's actual revenue, capex, and opex numbers would show up.

# ""Other Gross Profit Per Unit - GPU""

Carvana mentioned their ""Total gross profit per unit (""GPU"") was $7,427."" on their [Q3 2024 report](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2024.pdf).

They arrive at this figure by adding together ""Retail GPU"", ""Wholesale GPU"", and ""Other GPU"". I find this calculation quite suspicious tbh but I want to focus on **""Other GPU""** instead, which was $3,000. 

Going back to the [2023 Annual Report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000093/cvna-20231231.htm):

>""Other sales and revenues, which primarily includes gains on the sales of finance receivables we originate and sales commissions on ancillary products such as VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and auto insurance, totaled $753 million and $741 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (...) **Other sales and revenues are 100% gross margin products for which gross profit equals revenue**."" (...)

>""We generate other sales and revenues primarily through the sales of loans we originate and sell in securitization transactions or to financing partners, reported net of a reserve for expected repurchases, commissions we receive on VSCs, sales of GAP waiver coverage, and commissions and Root Warrants we receive on sales of auto insurance"" (...)

>""In 2016, we entered into a master dealer agreement with DriveTime, pursuant to which **we receive a commission for selling VSCs that DriveTime administers**. The commission revenue we recognize on VSCs depends on the number of retail units we sell, the conversion rate of VSCs on these sales, commission rates we receive, VSC early cancellation frequency and product features. The GAP waiver coverage revenue we recognize depends on the number of retail units we sell, the number of customers that choose to finance their purchases with us, the frequency of GAP waiver coverage early cancellation, and the conversion rate of GAP waiver coverage on those sales."" (...)

>""**DriveTime purchases wholesale vehicles from, and sells wholesale vehicles to, both the Company and unrelated third parties** through both competitive online auctions that are managed by unrelated third parties and the Company's wholesale marketplace platform. Additionally, beginning in September 2023, **the Company provided DriveTime with reconditioning services through its wholesale marketplace platform. The Company recognized $19 million, $32 million, and $54 million of wholesale sales and revenues from DriveTime** during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.""

Carvana engages in transactions with DriveTime **'not always at arm’s length,'** and DriveTime accounts for a relevant portion of Carvana's revenue and gross profit. This can be a problem.

Consider also a **hypothetical** scenario:

Imagine a vehicle with a market price of $10,000. Carvana buys it from a customer for $10,000 and then sells it to DriveTime for $11,000. DriveTime reconditions the vehicle and sells it back to Carvana at a wholesale price of $8,000. Carvana then sells it to a customer for $10,500.

* Carvana gross profit: $3,500
* DriveTime gross profit: -$3,000 (excl. costs)

This wouldn't be sustainable unless: 1. you own and control both companies, 2. one of them is publicly traded and sensitive to profitability metrics, and 3. you have the ability to sell shares whenever needed.

Please I'm not suggesting this happens at Carvana, but given their *not always at arm's length arrangements* and the lack of detailed data, this scenario remains a possibility. We rely on the work of their auditors to ensure that this is not the case.

# How to validate that hypothesis?

We would need to investigate the benefits Carvana receives, verify any discrepancies from reality, consider internal transactions, and calculate how these might affect the GPU and other metrics. Unfortunately, SEC reports don't offer enough info for that.

Based on their [2024 Proxy Meeting document](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/proxy-statement-2024.pdf), these are the agreements between Carvana and DriveTeam entities and how Carvana has recognized revenue and expenses (summarized via GPT):

# SG&A Expenses

On a side note, I found it impressive how they've managed to grow retail units sold and expand market hubs without increasing their SG&A expenses over the quarters.

https://preview.redd.it/tiyxx6fztw4e1.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbb011b2e54031366e11afd3614f45dd19773ff6

They expanded from \~120,000 retail and wholesale vehicles sold in Q3 2023 to +160,000 within 12 months, keeping their market occupancy and logistics costs flat. This should be featured as a case study by Harvard Business Review.

Quick Note: Under ""definitional differences to consider"" on [this document from Q4 2023](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q4-2023.pdf), ""Limited Warranty Expenses"" and ""Outbound Logistics Expenses"" are included in SG&A expense rather than COGS. Given that, I'd have expected SG&A to increase as a result of selling +35% more vehicles.

NVDA YOLO 14k,2024-12-04 20:27:44,"I see NVDA as a can't-miss investment opportunity in the age of AI. As a core enabler of generative AI and high-performance computing, NVDA is A100 and H100 chips, as well as its CUDA platform, have become the first choice for AI training and inference. In particular, NVDA is data center business is growing more than 170% year-over-year in 2023, as generative AI demand continues to drive its explosive performance

While companies such as AWS and Google are developing their own chips, I believe NVDA, with its technology and strong ecosystem, will be difficult to replace in the short term. What's more, the AI wave has just begun, and NVDA is businesses such as Omniverse and Autonomous Driving have huge potential to be tapped

Recently NVDA is CFO stated that they will be sub-acquiring companies, which reflects the fact that they have good cash flow

NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market: bubble risk and rational layout of industry giants ’,2024-12-04 19:56:50,"https://preview.redd.it/8ei98fya0w4e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbc0a93b262593e8ea76c7e7efbfacacac3502b5

As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world.

Analyse the results:

The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing.



GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on.



Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price.

NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market.



Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation.



Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry.



Analyse the results:

Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market.



If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD.



In summary: future outlook and risks

Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving.



NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share.



Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years.

The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble

Your Most Expensive RDDT Scroll: A Story From 2026,2024-12-04 10:56:25,"**Charles Dickens here (tl;dr at the end):** *Thanksgiving 2026. Your electric car just auto-parked (still no flying cars, thanks Elon). Walking in, you hear uncle Dave's voice over the turkey: ""This readit thing is amazing! Found out how to fix my garage door on the DIY subbit last week. Bought some shares at $300 when my buddy at Fidelity wouldn't shut up about it. Hey, weren't you always on this reddit site?""*

The same RDDT that's now everyone's go-to for actually useful answers instead of SEO garbage that used to trend at the top of search results. The site you're still checking 47 times a day.

# Let's Rewind to 2024 When You (Maybe) Missed It

Here are the numbers staring you in the face right now:

* 90% margins (better than Google, thanks to text-based content and mods)
* 68% revenue growth year over year
* 97.2M daily users growing 47% annually
* Data licensing up 547% (turns out our shitposting has value)
* Wall Street quietly loading up (+122% institutional ownership change)

[⭐ Former CEO Yishan casually dropped the blueprint 3 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gomnhh/comment/lwnsl9e/): *""Reddit is one of the largest actually-useful-content sites on the internet. That by itself is a moat.""* **and** *""In Reddit's case, the core strength is that basically everyone else gave up on the ""classic internet"" of true user forums and all the richness that comes with that. The fact that everyone now appends ""reddit"" to their search queries means that Reddit just accidentally ate search, while AI search is still unreliable.""*

While other platforms chased AI chatbots, Reddit doubled down on being the place for real human knowledge - **and they are now getting paid for this by -all- ML/AI providers to train their models in an ongoing way.** Why should it stop? Imagine if Google stopped indexing the web in 2021, how useful would it be?

# Congratulations, You Had Alpha and (Maybe) Acted Like a Beta

Alpha, aka you can beat the market due to ""not yet fully priced in"". For once in your life, you actually had insider information and a headstart. You've been using this platform daily for years, watching it grow, survive blackouts and rebellions, seeing the engagement firsthand. Everyone said at one point ""that is enough, I'm leaving"", and yet here we are.

Look at the institutional ownership story (based on Finviz data)

* Pinterest: 77%
* Snap: 51%
* Reddit: 39%, and growing crazy (+122% increase, mostly since the Q3 number revelation)

Translation: Those Chad analysts who just ""discovered"" Reddit still have % of buying to do just to match other social platforms. The same guys writing [$180 price targets](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/reddit-price-target-raised-180-120-loop-capital) are probably reading this post right now for their next investment thesis, updating their PowerPoints about ""untapped market potential"" and ""engagement metrics"" that you've been seeing firsthand for years.

They're figuring out that:

1. The platform has better margins than Google (90%) - thanks to mostly text-based content
2. Growing faster than Pinterest or Snap ever did - thanks to Google-vouch and ML localization
3. With the latest AI-craze, their non-stop, text-base, perfectly crawlable human content can be heavily licensed ($)

For once, you were early to something. You had the inside track. And you're letting Patagonia-vested-dudes steal your lunch money while he expense-accounts his at Sweetgreen.

# The Path to $100B You Should Have Seen Coming

Pinterest peaked at $50B showing wedding cakes. Twitter sold for $44B before becoming whatever it is now. Reddit at $26B:

* Actually profitable
* Better margins than both combined
* Still only using 1/3 to 1/2 of potential ad space compred to others
* Machine learning translation rolling out to 30+ countries (tests in France showed +50% growth)
* The only major platform still growing users at 47% YoY
* See chart below: **relative** Google Trend (per platform) shows RDDT is more trending than ever before

You're reading this on Reddit right now. Probably about to check the comments to see if I'm full of shit, then go back looking to find ""deep value plays"" in Malaysian basket weaving companies. Meanwhile the RDDT flywheel is spinning faster and faster.

So, when you get asked at Thanksgiving 2026 why you didn't invest in the site you spent 4-8 hours a day on, what's your excuse going to be?

# TL;DR

RDDT is now profitable, growing 47% YoY with 90% margins, institutions are loading up fast, and you're reading this on their platform right now, thinking you missed the boat at $150 - newsflash: you didn't (yet).

$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration,2024-12-03 00:00:18,"Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret. This analysis is not written by ChatGPT, hopefully not nauseatingly sales-y, and has no regarded emojis or over the top use of “To the Moon”. No frills, just my take on where I think there is deep value.

**Overview:**  
Earth observation data as a business has long struggled to be profitable. It requires significant CAPEX, is high risk (strapping a cam to a rocket essentially), and the R+D on a lot of the imaging can be pretty exorbitant. The main leader in the space, Planet Labs, went public in the SPAC boom. As a whole, they’ve underperformed the promises they presented in their first prospectus. Planet Labs sought to be a ""One to Many"" data provider, and their main selling point was that earth data could be widely commercialized. While this is still fundamentally true, in the time since going public they have essentially become a government contractor (75% revenue from some form of government with only a quarter from general business use) (source: Q2 Investor Presentation). Revenue being sourced primarily from the government is two sides of the same coin and the value lies in the eye of the beholder: it's bad because they are too reliant on too few customers, or that government revenue is extremely sticky and a major growth driver under the right administration. I am of the latter opinion.

I think we are at an inflection point that could cause Planet Labs to become far more profitable than they are currently, which will cause their valuation to adjust higher (far higher than even their recent run-up). While the use cases for the their data is very broad, it has become evident in the last few years that the most profitable one is government use.

**My thesis lies in the following:**

1. Donny and a Republican majority House/Senate will have a much larger Defense and Intelligence budget. They will be willing to pay a premium to obtain top tier defense and intelligence data from vendors like $PL.
2. NATO contract is highly promising (https://spacenews.com/planet-signs-deal-with-nato-to-supply-satellite-imagery/) and is a first of its kind deal. Follow-on mandates to come if $PL executes.
3. Launch of Tanager-1 (a first of its kind methane specific tracking satellite - highly valuable for int'l governments seeking to gather data on parties with the most harmful emissions) and subsequent release of data should bolster top-line (new sales team will hopefully execute).

Also before you ask, why can’t RKLB, SpaceX, etc. just strap cameras to their rockets? Or why can’t Starlink tack some cameras on their satellites? Boiled down most simply: they can’t do it efficiently or cost-effectively. They’d have to divert time and resources away from their primary businesses (which already have their own significant challenges) just to fight an uphill battle; this can be discussed more at length if clarity is needed but I just don’t see it as a likely scenario. Generally speaking this would more likely materialize as a continued symbiotic relationship (Planet Labs uses SpaceX rockets to launch their satellite constellations for example).

**Other thoughts:**  
Larger market cap compared to closest peer, no debt, invests more heavily in development of new technologies (I view this as a plus long term - they understand that earth images can be commoditized and are spending heavily to develop a suite of analytics products which can materially enhance user experience - this will create competitive advantage long-term; and yes before you ask, their data is being used to train AI models - see Laconic deal today - perfect example of their R+D spend beginning to pay off), recently trimmed workforce (leaner operating structure), largest and highest-quality satellite fleet (and it's not even close - actually a staggering difference), multiple partnerships with Google (Google owns \~12%), rumors are circling that they will finally announce positive adj EBITDA either this quarter or next (management has been targeting Q4)

**Position and Price Target**:  
I am planning to update this and positions continuously; I do believe in the growth of PL and will likely add on. May roll the 12/20’s, not decided yet.

Position:  
12/20/2025 $5C 9x  
4/17/2025 $5C 4x

Target: $PL 5/1/2025: $10/share

**TLDR:**  
Earth data used for defense and intelligence will become significantly more valuable over the next year due to major administrative tailwinds. Donny's Department of Defense will award more government contracts at a higher value, which will finally let them scale in the way they were meant to (R+D, Capex, and cash burn from last few years will all be justified by a stronger top-line). The mature business model for $PL is essentially a software company with high gross margins. The margin expansion will finally be realized as more contracts are awarded and valuations will correct accordingly. Additionally, while they do seek to serve a wide array of industries (i.e. agriculture, natural resources, etc.) the biggest short term tailwinds (I think) will be defense and intelligence contracts.

Also - it is impossible to have covered all the bases in this, so shoot your questions below and let's discuss. Happy to try and answer/clarify any of the above points. Lastly, I am a complete regard lol I could be wrong; not financial advice.",WallStreetBets

NovoCure's Tumor-Treating Electric Fields Shows Promise In Pancreatic Cancer Patients,2024-12-02 16:03:38,"On Monday, NovoCure Ltd (NASDAQ:NVCR) and Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ:ZLAB) revealed topline data from the Phase 3 PANOVA-3 trial of Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.



The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival (mOS) versus control.



Also Read: FDA Approves NovoCure's Portable Device Producing Tumor-Treating Electric Fields For Previously Treated Lung Cancer Patients



In the intent-to-treat population, patients treated with TTFields therapy concomitant with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel had an mOS of 16.20 months compared to 14.16 months in patients treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone, a statistically significant 2.0-month improvement (hazard ratio=0.819; *P*=0.039) (N=571).



The survival rate benefit for patients treated with TTFields therapy increased over time, with a 13% improvement in the overall survival rate at 12 months and a 33% improvement in survival rate at 24 months.



TTFields therapy was well-tolerated, and safety was consistent with prior clinical studies. Novocure plans to file for regulatory approval in the U.S., EU, Japan and other key markets. Zai Lab plans to file for regulatory approval in China.



Novocure continues to follow patients in its Phase 2 PANOVA-4 trial, which is exploring the use of TTFields therapy together with atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. PANOVA-4 has completed enrollment, and data are anticipated in 2026.

T hasn't made it to the white house yet and he's already cleaning house and arranging furniture, meeting with heads of state as if he's really running things. He's lucky Elon is right there next to him doing the heavy lifting to make things more - efficient.

It got me wondering about the defense sector. The pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of Uncle Sam's check book because he doesn't really know what hes signing off on.

Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their, corrupt pricing over the years.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line. Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal. So things are staring to look more peaceful. Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace.

So the question is, are defense contractors overvalued?

🚨Bag-holder DD alert: TWLO ALL IN with nvda sprinkles 🚨,2024-12-02 05:16:23,"Maybe there is a bag-holder bug going around... I hope my case isn't too bad. 

Tldr:
I'm all in TWLO with nvda sprinkles because Twilio is an ""AI pick and shovel"" play that is being heavily slept on lol. AI is going to the moon. TWLO is also trading at a significant discount relative to its SaaS peers. 

Just look at its weekly chart. Durrrr. 

Also, I don't think I have to say anything about NVDA besides ""buy the dip.""

Real TLDR at very bottom if you don't wanna read. 




Why am I being regarded?


1. I've been inspired by people like ElonIloveyou or whatever that guy's name is, and hopefully, if I hop on the wave quick enough, I can ride it to Valhalla :) 


2. TWLO is SO cheap right now

Although it fell fantastically... what goes down must always go up?

- Current Price-to-Sales (P/S): 2.6x

This is drastically lower than SaaS peers like Snowflake (25x) or ServiceNow (14x). For context, Twilio’s P/S ratio peaked at 20x plus during its high-growth phase in 2021.

- Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue: 3.8x 

This is also much lower than peers (Smartsheet at 5.6-5.7x, ServiceNow at 12.5-13.8x, ZoomInfo at 7.7x).


3. Although they aren't profitable (who tf is and who cares), their revenue growth is strong and growing and their & margins are healthy.

- Revenue (TTM): $4.07 billion (a solid 10% YoY growth in a tough macro environment)

- Gross margins are stabilizing at 50%

- Cash Balance: $3.8 billion

TWLO has also maintained very low debt compared to peers


4. TWLO has many tailwinds

- Twilio’s recent initiatives include embedding generative AI and predictive analytics into its platforms. TWLO's most recent guidance signaled this advancement to be a significant revenue driver long term.

- Twilio has implemented significant cost-cutting measures and achieved $150 million in annualized savings in Q3 - by focusing on core high-margin products while exiting non-core businesses (Prolly some more tech layoffs around the corner across the board).

- Valuable collabs with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce enhance Twilio’s market reach.

- The global CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) market is expected to grow from $12 billion in 2023 to $35 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of ~16%. Twilio dominates this space.

- HEAVY INSTITUTIONAL ACCUMULATION HAS OCCURRED RECENTLY. Vanguard and BlackRock have increased their stakes. The big fish are confident in the TWLO turn aruond story.


5. The technical ANALysis says calls, I think.  

- TWLO has broken above its 200-day moving average

- Key support levels: $102, $98.50, $92.

- Resistance levels: $110, $115, and $120.

- High open interest in near-term $110 and $115 calls, super DUPER low IV... maybe for a reason, but idk.


TLDR:
TWLO Is Primed for Upside because:

- Twilio is heavily discounted on all valuation metrics, providing a high margin of safety.

- AI-driven products and cost optimizations are setting the stage for sustained margin growth.

- Technical and options data suggest growing institutional and retail interest.

If you’re looking for a quality tech SaaS play at value-stock prices, Twilio deserves a spot on your radar. Shares and/or options will definitely hit, probably. 

I posted my positions. Not sure when I’ll sell…I will likely be the catalyst for the next leg up.

Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,2024-12-03 19:49:45,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",investing

Investing $20k USD using IBKR as a non-us resident ,2024-12-02 13:20:37,"I am from Pakistan and just signed up on IBKR.

I have $20k USD sitting in my Wise account that gives me nothing. Its like 15% of total net worth.

I don't have debt at all. All my monthly expenses are covered easily by my job. So these funds are just sitting idle.

I have tried crypto but lost like $2k in futures trading.

I want to grow my savings gradually. 

Should I DCA into VOO $1k/month?

Should I DCA like $100/month or $200/month into TESLA NVIDIA or any other IT company.

I know they are part of VOO but investing individually can give higher returns if DCA works perfectly.",investing

A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,2024-12-01 10:04:38,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

Thoughts on Tesla in December,2024-12-01 08:54:01,"So right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

But I really feel like it is so risky to invest in the stock. Maybe a smal call option just to not miss out but also keep liquidity?",investing
Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,2024-12-03 01:32:53,,finance
MDA Space $MDALF is profitable and will possibly be trading in the US Stock market soon,2024-12-04 22:54:33,"This great Canadian Space sector company ( [https://mda.space](https://mda.space) ) has a beautiful chart showing their growth and is profitable. They have market cap of 3.2 Billion. What do they do?

MDA Space is a technology and services company that provides advanced solutions to the global space industry:

* **Geointelligence**: Uses satellite data and imagery for climate change monitoring, national security, and global commerce
* **Robotics & Space Operations**: Provides autonomous robotics and vision sensors for space exploration
* **Satellite Systems**: Provides spacecraft and systems for space-based services, including broadband internet connectivity 

MDA Space has a history of firsts and over 450 missions. They have been providing operational readiness support for the International Space Station's (ISS) Mobile Servicing System since 2001. They are also known for delivering large-scale robotic systems, such as Canadarm2.

And this excerpt from a post by user manolo44 sure is bullish:

""Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.""

And then I heard this:

MDA Space, which is a sleeping giant merely because it trades in the TSE rather than US, is exploring listing in the US, according to comments by its CEO;

“Management suggested that it continues to explore a potential dual stock listing in the U.S.""

[https://www.cantechletter.com/2024/11/mda-will-prosper-under-trump-2-0-rbc-says/#](https://www.cantechletter.com/2024/11/mda-will-prosper-under-trump-2-0-rbc-says/#)

Now I am not sure how a dual listing will effect my 500 MDALF shares but if I had to guess I would say it will be a good thing.

There have been posts on Reddit about how bad of a company they are to their employees, but just like Yelp you usually only hear about the bad apples, not the good ones, so I take that with a grain of salt. This article that came out today today says they are ""one of Toronto's greatest employers""

Thoughts on Tesla in December,2024-12-01 08:54:01,"So right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

But I really feel like it is so risky to invest in the stock. Maybe a smal call option just to not miss out but also keep liquidity?",investing
